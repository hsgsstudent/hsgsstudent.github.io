Welcome to my homepage! My name is Nguyen Hoang Viet, and I am currently a final-year Computer Science student at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn). I am conducting research in quantum optimization and quantum machine learning under the supervision of Professor [Trinh Chien](https://sites.google.com/site/chientrinhvn). In addition, I am also interested in the interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts models, particularly the theoretical foundations of gating mechanisms and expert architectures, under the supervision of Professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io). 

Research Interests
======

My research aims to develop a rigorous theoretical understanding of Mixture-of-Experts models, with a particular focus on the parameter estimation rates of both expert components and routing mechanisms. Beyond theory, I seek to bridge foundational insights with practical AI applications, not only in Mixture-of-Experts models but also in broader machine learning architectures.

In parallel, I explore quantum optimization and quantum machine learning, where tools from mathematics, statistical learning, and quantum information theory intersect. 

I’m actively seeking PhD positions in Statistics AI for the upcoming academic year and excited to collaborate on impactful research!
