Welcome to my homepage! My name is Nguyen Hoang Viet, and I am currently a final-year Computer Science student at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn). My research focuses on the interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts models, particularly the theory of gating mechanisms and expert architectures, under the supervision of Professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io). 


Research Interests
======

My research focuses on understanding the parameter estimation rates of both experts and routing modules in Mixture-of-Experts models. In addition, I am also interested in quantum machine learning and related problems. 

I’m actively seeking PhD positions in Mathematics AI for the upcoming academic year and excited to collaborate on impactful research!
